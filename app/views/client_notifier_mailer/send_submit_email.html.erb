    <h1>Thanks for your Pick Up Request, <%= @client.first_name %>!</h1>
    <p>Our team is cleaning the sap of their hands as we speak, and will get your tree on our pick up schedule for the date you requested.</p>
    <p>Please note, the time that the tree is ready is not necessarily the exact time we will be there to grab it, but we will come as soon as we can during that day to grab it. Our trucks pick up hundreds of trees per day from 9am to 6pm on our pick up days, but not to worry, we won't forget yours!</p>
    <p>Here is your submitted information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><%= @client.first_name %> <%= @client.last_name %></li>
      <li><%= @client.email %></li>
      <li><%= @client.phone_number %></li>
      <li><a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=<%= @client.pick_up_location %>&t=m" target="_blank"><%= @client.pick_up_location %>, <%= @client.city %></a></li>
      <li><%= @client.pick_up_date %></li>
      <li><%= @client.pick_up_time.strftime("%l:%M %p") %></li>
    </ul>
    <p>If any of the information is incorrect, please let us know so we don't pick up the wrong tree!</p>
    <p>Thanks so much.</p>
